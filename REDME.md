this is a 11.ty template with sanity admin

it is based on the santiy starter template and modified to my requirements

https://github.com/sanity-io/sanity-template-eleventy-blog/tree/55a9cfbd5e525070a44de68b3e7357e157e1bd70

It uses cloudflare pages for hosting, github to store the repo, sanity for the CMS / API and eleventy for the JAM frontend.

It is all in one repo can can be hosted fully in cloudflare.
